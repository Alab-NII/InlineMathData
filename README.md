# InlineMathData

We released annotated data for in-line mathematical expression detection.

## Description
If a word is a mathematical expression, the span of the word has the `data-math` attribute, whose value is `B-Math` or `I-Math`. These tags are based on simple BIO-tags, but `O-Math` is not annotated.
